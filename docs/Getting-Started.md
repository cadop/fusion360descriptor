=================

Installation & Running
-----------------

- Download the repository as .zip or run `git clone https://github.com/cadop/fusion360descriptor.git` in Git Bash to download the repository.
- Navigate to the **Utilities** tab in Fusion and click on **Scripts and Add-Ins**.
- Click on the green + to add the script into Fusion.
- Add the **Descriptor** folder from the zip file to the scripts. You may have to unzip the file after downloading from Github

- Rather than configuring the export manually in the GUI, you can create a YAML configuration file to control the export. A number of more
  advanced features are only available via the configuraiton file. See `configuration_sample.yaml` for more information.

An extensive, step by step procedure can be found at [Step-by-Step Guide](#step-by-step-guide).

FAQ
-----------------

**Q:** How can I visualize the URDF generated by my Fusion model?

**A:** We recommend PyBullet; the converter generates a sample `hello_bullet.py` to get started with your URDF.

**Q:** How do I install PyBullet?

**A:** Ensure that Python, pip, and Microsoft Visual Studio C++ build tools are installed. Check with `which python` and `which pip`. At the command line, run `pip install pybullet`.

**Q:** How can I create more advanced models?

**A:** A good place to find pre-built components is the *McMASTERR-CARR* component directory. To go to this, click on **Insert** in the top menu bar, and in the drop down menu, go to **Insert McMASTERR-Carr Component**. Then, you can find your desired component, click on the specifications of choice, go to **Product Detail**, and press **Download**.
