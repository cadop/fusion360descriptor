Fusion Descriptor
=================

Important Credits
-----------------

This a modified version of the fusion2urdf (https://github.com/syuntoku14/fusion2urdf) and fusion2pybullet (https://github.com/yanshil/Fusion2PyBullet) repositories. Many thanks for these authors and their communities building out the tools and showing what was possible.  

**Why Another?**


This project was developed to solve some internal problems with our robot configuration and exporting. Between the stated end of development for the original repo and the priorities of the pybullet version, we felt it was best to make our own version and rewrite most of the fusion-side code.  Naturally, we also wanted to understand the fusion API better, so this was a nice project to get started. 


Overview
--------

This project aims to help export link configurations and mechanical descriptions to XML (e.g. URDF) formats (and ideally, other formats as well in the future), from Fusion 360. 

It provides a simple GUI for running the script and choosing a few different settings.  

**Features**

- GUI interface for settings
- Uses the grounded base as root node, that organizes the UDRF tree by joint/link distance from root.
- Handles rigid groups, coordinate transforms between origins, nested assemblies, etc
- Allows switching between units
- WYSIWYG stl exporting (exports model as you see on the screen) without needing to save design history or copy to a new file
- Preview joint relationship before exporting
- Export only URDF without Mesh (for fast viewing)
- Can export component bodies separately as a visual element of URDF and a combined component as the collision
- Can load export configuration from a Yaml file to speed up configuring the export.
- Additional advanced options can be specified in the Yaml file, such as automatically mapping component and/or joint names to custom names in URDF.
  This is helpful to e.g. keep the URDF names constant as the Fusion design is updated, so that ROS configuration/code does not have to be changed.

Step-by-Step Guide
------------------

**Creating a Fusion 360 Model**

- Navigate to the **Solid** tab at the top of the screen and click on **Create Sketch**.

- Click on **Finish Sketch**. You should now be back under the **Solid** tab.
- Click on **Extrude** and drag on the rectangle that you have created until you have a 3D shape of your choosing. Click on on **OK**.

- Now, you should have a 3D shape categorized under **Bodies** on the left side.

- Create a second rectangle following the above instructions that is adjacent to the first one. Make sure they are touching in some way.

- You can move a body by right clicking on the body name on the left side and clicking **Move/Copy**, or by pressing **M** on the keyboard.

- Right click on **Bodies** and click on *Create Components from Bodies*. Both bodies should now be **Components**.

- Make sure that one of these components are grounded. To do so, right click on the component on the left side and click on **Ground**. 
- A red indicator should appear next to the name of the component that shows it is grounded.

- Now, go to the **Surface** tab and click on **Joint**.

- Add the joint to each component, where they are touching. Make sure this joint has motion type **Rigid**. A **Joints** category should appear on the left side.
- Navigate to the **Utilities** tab at the top of the screen and click on **Scripts and Add-Ins**.

- Add the **Descriptor** folder from the zip file to the scripts.
- Click on **Descriptor** then click on **Run**. The GUI will appear.
- Add a save directory for the output and select the desired options.
